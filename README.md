# First Thursday Art Walk Map

The objective of our project is to build a map for art walk visitors attending the Pioneer Square First Thursday Art Walk. The current map and website is not easy for visitors to use as the current ways of finding a gallery is difficult to navigate and doesn't take into account the visitor's location.

We wanted to solve this problem by creating an interactive map that could be used in a variety of ways. We implemented geolocation so that the visitor knows their location in reference to the galleries. We also provide details about the gallery so that the visitor can decide where they want to go. Lastly, if a visitor knows another point of reference, they can use the search box to find it. To maintain a consistent brand experience, this page mirrors the current Pioneer Square website.
