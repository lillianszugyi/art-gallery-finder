# First Thursday Art Walk Map

The objective of our project is to build a map for art walk visitors attending the Pioneer Square First Thursday Art Walk. The current map and website is not easy for visitors to use as the current ways of finding a gallery is difficult to navigate and doesn't take into account the visitor's location.

We wanted to solve this problem by creating an interactive map that could be used in a variety of ways. We implemented geolocation so that the visitor knows their location in reference to the galleries. We also provide details about the gallery so that the visitor can decide where they want to go. Lastly, if a visitor knows another point of reference, they can use the search box to find it. To maintain a consistent brand experience, this page mirrors the current Pioneer Square website.  

# Resources

These are the resources we started out with:

- [First Thursday Art Walk](http://www.pioneersquare.org/experiences/first-thursday-art-walk)

- [Participating galleries and venues](http://www.pioneersquare.org/the-neighborhood/arts/participating-first-thursday-galleries-venues)

- [Art Walk Map](http://www.pioneersquare.org/images/uploads/files/Art_Walk_Map.pdf)

- [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)

# Here are some things we had to use to build the page

- User Stories
- DRY programming
- CSS properties (flexbox, box-shadow, text-overflow, border-radius)
- Javascript (DOM manipulation, Google Maps API, Google Map Options, user input, event listeners, IIFE, constructor functions)

### Created by Lillian Szugyi and Serina Tsang, for Code Fellows 201n2 final project, February 2016.
