# art-gallery-finder

- The objective of our project is to build a user-friendly art gallery finder page containing a google map with markers that represent art galleries participating in the Pioneer Square First Thursday Art Walk. Each marker will be clickable and will provide a description of the gallery, along with a link to the gallery's website. Our page will also have a convenient search box to look up not only the galleries but also google places for reference. The same colors, fonts and layout in the current Pioneer Square website will be used to make our page look like an extension of the website.

# stuff we learned

- HTML elements (flexbox, containers, input element)
- CSS properties (display, flex, block, box-sizing, box-shadow, text-overflow, border-radius)
- Javascript (Google Maps API, Places search box, map/searchBox/mapCenter/marker event listeners such as 'bounds_changed', 'places_changed', 'idle', 're-size' and 'click'), null value, if/else statements, IIFE function, InfoWindow constructor, google.maps.Marker constructor)
